## Dependencies

To compile .proto files: `apt-get install protobuf-compiler`.

To compile chrome.proto for use with grpc-web you'll need to put
protoc-gen-grpc-web from https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web into $PATH.

TODO: `npx` seems to be install just with `sudo apt-get install npm`? Or was it
install with `npm install` run out of grpc-web repo?
